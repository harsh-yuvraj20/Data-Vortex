## 1. Competition Requirements

Phase 2 of the Data Vortex competition transitions from dataset inspection, cleaning, and exploratory analysis into structured relational database querying.

### Mandatory Rules & Constraints:
1. **Single Source of Truth:** All queries must execute exclusively against the verified SQLite database at `data/data_vortex.db`.
2. **Strict Immutability:**
   - Zero modification to `data/raw/` or `data/cleaned/` CSV files.
   - Zero alteration to the relational tables, schemas, or existing data in `data/data_vortex.db`.
   - Analytical queries must be read-only (`SELECT`).
3. **Foreign Key Enforcement:** Foreign key constraints are active (`PRAGMA foreign_keys = ON;`), maintaining strict 1:N referential integrity (`posts.user_id -> users.user_id`).
4. **Transparent NULL Handling:** Missing values in `platform` (1,784), `text_content` (1,711), and `likes` (1,814) must be handled transparently using SQL `IS NULL`, `COALESCE`, or explicit conditional logic without artificial imputation.
5. **No Data Fabrication:** Queries must evaluate empirical records without inventing placeholder metrics or arbitrary classifications.
6. **Reproducibility & Evidence:** All final SQL queries must be stored in `sql/`, documented in `reports/`, executed in interactive notebooks under `notebooks/`, and verified with output captures in `outputs/screenshots/`.
