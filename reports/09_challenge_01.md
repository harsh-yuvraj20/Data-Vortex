# Challenge 1 — Platform Interaction Benchmarks

**Competition:** Data Vortex — Round 1 Phase 2
**Challenge:** 01 — Platform Interaction Benchmarks
**Database File:** `data/data_vortex.db`
**Target Table:** `posts`
**Difficulty:** Easy
**Date:** 2026-09-14
**Status:** **COMPLETED & VALIDATED**

---

## 1. Objective

The objective of Challenge 1 is to analyze social media interaction performance across publishing channels. For each platform represented in the `posts` table, the query calculates:
1. **Platform Name** (`platform`): Labeling missing entries as `'Unknown'` via `COALESCE`.
2. **Post Count** (`post_count`): Total number of posts published on that channel.
3. **Average Likes** (`avg_likes`): Mean likes per post.
4. **Average Shares** (`avg_shares`): Mean shares per post.
5. **Average Comments** (`avg_comments`): Mean comments per post.
6. **Average Total Interactions** (`avg_total_interactions`): Mean combined interaction volume per post ($\text{total\_interactions} = \text{likes} + \text{shares} + \text{comments}$).

The final output is sorted by `avg_total_interactions` in descending order.

## 2. SQL Query

The verified SQL query is stored in [`sql/challenge_01_platform_interaction_benchmarks.sql`](../sql/challenge_01_platform_interaction_benchmarks.sql):

```sql
SELECT
    COALESCE(platform, 'Unknown') AS platform,
    COUNT(*) AS post_count,
    ROUND(AVG(likes), 2) AS avg_likes,
    ROUND(AVG(shares), 2) AS avg_shares,
    ROUND(AVG(comments), 2) AS avg_comments,
    ROUND(AVG(COALESCE(likes, 0) + COALESCE(shares, 0) + COALESCE(comments, 0)), 2) AS avg_total_interactions
FROM posts
GROUP BY COALESCE(platform, 'Unknown')
ORDER BY avg_total_interactions DESC;
```

## 3. Query Explanation

Below is a beginner-friendly breakdown of each component of the SQL query:

1. **`COALESCE(platform, 'Unknown') AS platform`**:
   - `COALESCE()` is an ANSI standard SQL function that evaluates arguments in order and returns the first non-NULL value.
   - When `platform` contains a valid string (e.g. `'Facebook'`), it returns `'Facebook'`.
   - When `platform` is SQL `NULL` (missing), it returns `'Unknown'`.
   - This creates a clean label in the query result set without altering or updating the underlying database records.

2. **`COUNT(*) AS post_count`**:
   - Counts the total number of rows associated with each platform group, including rows with missing metric values.

3. **`ROUND(AVG(likes), 2) AS avg_likes`**:
   - `AVG(likes)` computes the arithmetic mean ($\frac{\sum x}{n}$) of the `likes` column for that platform.
   - Standard SQL `AVG()` ignores `NULL` entries automatically, computing the mean strictly across available, non-missing likes ($n \approx 1,700$ per platform).
   - `ROUND(..., 2)` rounds the resulting floating-point value to 2 decimal places for readable reporting.

4. **`ROUND(AVG(shares), 2)` & `ROUND(AVG(comments), 2)`**:
   - Compute the arithmetic averages for shares and comments. Because shares and comments contain zero missing values ($n = 12,000$), the average is computed across the full cohort.

5. **`ROUND(AVG(COALESCE(likes, 0) + COALESCE(shares, 0) + COALESCE(comments, 0)), 2) AS avg_total_interactions`**:
   - In SQL arithmetic, adding `NULL` to any number yields `NULL` (`NULL + 100 = NULL`).
   - If a post has missing likes, standard addition (`likes + shares + comments`) would evaluate to `NULL`, causing that post to be completely excluded from the average.
   - Wrapping `likes` in `COALESCE(likes, 0)` treats missing likes as `0` for the combined sum, allowing all valid shares and comments for that post to contribute to total interactions.

6. **`FROM posts`**:
   - Specifies the target table containing post publication and interaction data.

7. **`GROUP BY COALESCE(platform, 'Unknown')`**:
   - Aggregates the 12,000 individual post rows into 6 discrete categorical buckets: the 5 known platforms and the single `'Unknown'` group.

8. **`ORDER BY avg_total_interactions DESC`**:
   - Sorts the resulting summary table from highest average total interactions to lowest.

### Methodological Comparison: Complete-Case vs. Zero-Filled Likes
To provide complete transparency, Table 4.2 compares the average total interactions when missing likes are treated as `0` versus when evaluated over complete cases (`likes IS NOT NULL`):

### Table 4.2: Comparison of Total Interactions by NULL Handling Method

| Platform | Total Posts ($N$) | Non-Missing Likes ($n$) | Avg Total Interactions (Zero-Filled Likes) | Avg Total Interactions (Complete-Cases Only) | Difference |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **Instagram** | 1,989 | 1,713 (86.1%) | **3,669.38** | **4,040.02** | +370.64 |
| **Reddit** | 2,031 | 1,747 (86.0%) | **3,647.47** | **4,003.94** | +356.47 |
| **YouTube** | 2,073 | 1,739 (83.9%) | **3,638.03** | **4,031.84** | +393.81 |
| **Facebook** | 2,074 | 1,757 (84.7%) | **3,631.00** | **4,015.99** | +384.99 |
| **Unknown** | 1,784 | 1,485 (83.2%) | **3,609.53** | **3,963.83** | +354.30 |
| **Twitter** | 2,049 | 1,745 (85.2%) | **3,563.75** | **3,951.91** | +388.16 |

In both calculations, **Instagram** ranks first, **Twitter** ranks sixth, and the variance across all platforms is less than 3%.

## 5. Key Findings

1. **Highest Average Total Interactions Platform:**
   - **Instagram** achieved the highest observed average total interactions at **3,669.38** interactions per post (and **4,040.02** among complete cases).
2. **Lowest Average Total Interactions Platform:**
   - **Twitter** recorded the lowest observed average total interactions at **3,563.75** interactions per post (and **3,951.91** among complete cases).
3. **Highest Post-Volume Platform:**
   - **Facebook** has the highest post volume with **2,074 posts** (17.28% of all posts), followed closely by YouTube (2,073 posts).
4. **Substantial Unknown Platform Volume:**
   - Posts with missing platform metadata account for **1,784 posts** (14.87% of all posts). Their average engagement ($3,609.53$) closely matches the identified platform averages.
5. **Observed Engagement Invariance:**
   - The spread between the highest average total interactions (Instagram: $3,669.38$) and lowest (Twitter: $3,563.75$) is only **105.63 interactions** (a 2.9% relative difference). This empirical narrowness confirms the Phase 1 finding that platform assignment does not drive engagement in this synthetic benchmark.

## 6. NULL Handling Deep Dive

### 6.1 Why `COALESCE` is Used
In SQLite, a `GROUP BY` on a column containing `NULL` will group all `NULL` values into a single bucket with an empty label. Using `COALESCE(platform, 'Unknown')`:
- Replaces the visual empty string with the explicit descriptor `'Unknown'`.
- Does not modify or overwrite data in the physical database file.
- Guarantees clean reporting in dashboards, CLI outputs, and automated exports.

### 6.2 Why `AVG()` is Appropriate
- `AVG()` calculates the central tendency ($\mu$) of continuous and integer metrics across cohorts.
- SQLite's implementation of `AVG()` natively follows ANSI SQL standards: it automatically ignores `NULL` values rather than treating them as zeros.
- For `avg_likes`, this ensures the divisor is the count of non-missing likes ($n = 10,186$), preventing artificial deflation.

### 6.3 Impact of NULLs on Total Interactions
When summing multiple columns in SQL:
$$\text{Total} = \text{likes} + \text{shares} + \text{comments}$$
- If `likes` is `NULL`, SQLite evaluates $\text{NULL} + 1,000 + 500 = \text{NULL}$.
- `AVG(likes + shares + comments)` would therefore silently drop all 1,814 posts with missing likes.
- By using `COALESCE(likes, 0)`, every post is retained, ensuring that the post count base for `avg_total_interactions` matches the full cohort size ($N = 12,000$).

## 7. Interpretation & Limitations

1. **Non-Causal Interpretation:**
   - While Instagram displays the highest observed average interaction count in this dataset, this reflects observational benchmark characteristics and does not indicate that publishing on Instagram causes higher audience engagement.
2. **Missing Platform Representation:**
   - 14.87% of posts lack platform tags. Because missingness is distributed evenly, attributing these posts to specific platforms without ground truth would introduce artificial bias.
3. **Synthetic Distribution Constraints:**
   - Engagement metrics in this benchmark are drawn from bounded uniform distributions ($\mathcal{U}(0, 5000)$ for likes, $\mathcal{U}(0, 2000)$ for shares, $\mathcal{U}(0, 1000)$ for comments). Consequently, real-world platform phenomena (such as viral power-law spikes or algorithmic feed boosting) are not present.
