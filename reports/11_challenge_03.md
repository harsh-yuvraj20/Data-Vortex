# Challenge 3 — Geographic Representation & Country Aggregation

**Competition:** Data Vortex — Round 1 Phase 2
**Challenge:** 03 — Geographic Representation & Country Aggregation
**Database File:** `data/data_vortex.db`
**Target Tables:** `users`, `posts`
**Difficulty:** Medium
**Date:** 2026-09-14
**Status:** **COMPLETED & VALIDATED**

---

## 1. Objective

The objective of Challenge 3 is to evaluate geographic representation across the user population and examine post interaction activity aggregated by country.

In the `users` table, the `location` attribute stores strings formatted as `"City, Country"` for 32 international locations (e.g. `"Berlin, Germany"`, `"Chicago, USA"`, `"São Paulo, Brazil"`). The sovereign city-state `"Singapore"` is stored without a delimiter.

The challenge requires:
1. Deriving national country entities dynamically in SQL without modifying the underlying database.
2. Handling `"Singapore"` accurately as its own country.
3. Conducting country-level user demographic analysis (user volume, follower distribution).
4. Conducting country-level post activity analysis (post volume, publishing frequency, engagement metrics).
5. Extracting the top 10 countries by total post volume.

---

## 2. Country Extraction Logic

Country extraction is achieved dynamically using standard SQLite string functions:

```sql
CASE
    WHEN INSTR(location, ',') > 0 THEN TRIM(SUBSTR(location, INSTR(location, ',') + 1))
    ELSE location
END AS country
```

### Operational Mechanics:
1. **`INSTR(location, ',')`**: Searches for the 1-based character position of the comma delimiter.
   - For `"Berlin, Germany"`, `INSTR` returns `7`.
   - For `"Singapore"`, there is no comma, so `INSTR` returns `0`.
2. **`CASE WHEN INSTR(...) > 0`**:
   - When a comma is present, `SUBSTR(location, INSTR(location, ',') + 1)` extracts all characters starting immediately after the comma (e.g. `" Germany"`).
   - `TRIM(...)` strips any leading whitespace, yielding the clean country string `"Germany"`.
3. **`ELSE location`**:
   - For records where no comma exists (specifically `"Singapore"`), the branch returns the location string directly (`"Singapore"`).
4. **Data Immutability:**
   - This derivation executes on-the-fly in a Common Table Expression (`WITH user_countries AS (...)`) without requiring an `ALTER TABLE` or `UPDATE` operation on the database.

## 3. SQL Queries

All queries are consolidated in [`sql/challenge_03_geographic_analysis.sql`](../sql/challenge_03_geographic_analysis.sql).

### Query 1: Country-Level User Demographic Analysis
```sql
WITH user_countries AS (
    SELECT
        user_id,
        follower_count,
        CASE
            WHEN INSTR(location, ',') > 0 THEN TRIM(SUBSTR(location, INSTR(location, ',') + 1))
            ELSE location
        END AS country
    FROM users
)
SELECT
    country,
    COUNT(*) AS user_count,
    ROUND(AVG(follower_count), 2) AS avg_followers,
    MIN(follower_count) AS min_followers,
    MAX(follower_count) AS max_followers
FROM user_countries
GROUP BY country
ORDER BY user_count DESC, country ASC;
```

### Query 2: Country-Level Post Publishing & Interaction Analysis
```sql
WITH user_countries AS (
    SELECT
        user_id,
        CASE
            WHEN INSTR(location, ',') > 0 THEN TRIM(SUBSTR(location, INSTR(location, ',') + 1))
            ELSE location
        END AS country
    FROM users
)
SELECT
    uc.country,
    COUNT(DISTINCT uc.user_id) AS user_count,
    COUNT(p.post_id) AS post_count,
    ROUND(CAST(COUNT(p.post_id) AS REAL) / COUNT(DISTINCT uc.user_id), 2) AS avg_posts_per_user,
    ROUND(AVG(p.likes), 2) AS avg_likes,
    ROUND(AVG(p.shares), 2) AS avg_shares,
    ROUND(AVG(p.comments), 2) AS avg_comments
FROM user_countries uc
INNER JOIN posts p ON uc.user_id = p.user_id
GROUP BY uc.country
ORDER BY post_count DESC, uc.country ASC;
```

## 7. Key Findings

### 7.1 Extremes Observed in the Data
1. **Country with the Most Users:**
   - **USA** was observed to have the highest user representation with **203 users** (13.53% of all users), driven by inclusion of four distinct metropolitan hubs (Chicago, Houston, Los Angeles, New York).
2. **Country with the Most Posts:**
   - **USA** accounted for the largest post volume with **1,645 posts** (13.71% of all posts).
3. **Country with the Highest Average Follower Count:**
   - **Nigeria** had the highest average follower count at **30,056.93 followers** across its 30 users.
4. **Country with the Highest Average Likes:**
   - **Egypt** was observed to have the highest average likes at **2,628.87 likes** per post (across 322 posts, 273 non-null likes).
5. **Country with the Lowest Activity Metrics:**
   - **Nigeria** represented the lowest post volume with **223 posts** (from 30 users).
   - **South Korea** had the lowest observed average likes at **2,355.72 likes** per post.

### 7.2 Geographic Engagement Invariance
- While post volumes differ across countries due to the number of constituent cities assigned during dataset generation (e.g., USA has 4 cities; Nigeria has 1 city), the **average posting frequency per user remains stable** between **7.31** (Singapore) and **8.49** (Brazil) posts per user.
- Average likes across all 19 countries remain within a narrow band of $[2,355, 2,629]$, average shares within $[972, 1,085]$, and average comments within $[472, 520]$.
- These findings show that geographic location was not associated with differential creator productivity or audience interaction rates.

---

## 8. NULL Handling

1. **`AVG(p.likes)` Automatically Ignores NULLs:**
   - In SQLite, the `AVG()` aggregate function sums only non-NULL values and divides by the count of non-NULL values.
   - For example, in Egypt, 49 of the 322 posts had missing likes; `AVG(p.likes)` divided the total likes by 273 populated posts, avoiding downward deflation.
2. **`COUNT(p.post_id)` Counts All Authored Posts:**
   - Because `post_id` is a non-null primary key, `COUNT(p.post_id)` accurately captures every post authored in that country regardless of whether `likes` or `platform` are `NULL`.
3. **`COUNT(DISTINCT uc.user_id)` Guarantees Accurate Creator Counts:**
   - In an `INNER JOIN` between users and posts, each user record is replicated for every post they published.
   - Using `COUNT(DISTINCT uc.user_id)` counts each user exactly once per country, ensuring the user count matches the demographic baseline (e.g. 203 for USA).
4. **Singapore String Handling:**
   - By evaluating `INSTR(location, ',') > 0`, the query branches to `ELSE location` for `"Singapore"`, avoiding empty string extraction.
5. **No Underlying Data Modified:**
   - Country derivation occurs strictly within the query scope; no table columns were added or altered.

---

## 9. Interpretation & Limitations

1. **Descriptive Non-Causal Language:**
   - The observed variations in user counts reflect the demographic distribution established during benchmark creation (e.g. 4 US cities vs. 1 Egyptian city). They do not indicate that creators in the US are inherently more prolific.
2. **Synthetic Geographic Uniformity:**
   - As established in Phase 1 ($\chi^2 = 279.56, p = 0.6283$), user language and follower allocations were assigned independently of geography. Country groupings reflect international diversity rather than localized cultural concentrations.
