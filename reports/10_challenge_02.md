# Challenge 2 — Top Creator Audience Leaderboard

**Competition:** Data Vortex — Round 1 Phase 2
**Challenge:** 02 — Top Creator Audience Leaderboard
**Database File:** `data/data_vortex.db`
**Target Tables:** `users`, `posts`
**Difficulty:** Easy
**Date:** 2026-09-14
**Status:** **COMPLETED & VALIDATED**

---

## 1. Objective

The objective of Challenge 2 is to construct a creator audience leaderboard ranking users by their registered follower count. For each qualifying creator who has authored at least one post, the query aggregates their publishing history to display:
1. **User Identifier** (`user_id`): Unique creator primary key.
2. **Geographic Location** (`location`): Metropolitan city and country of residence.
3. **Primary Language** (`language`): Two-letter ISO 639-1 language code.
4. **Follower Count** (`follower_count`): Total registered platform audience.
5. **Post Count** (`post_count`): Total number of social posts authored by the user.
6. **Average Likes** (`avg_likes`): Mean likes accumulated per post.
7. **Average Shares** (`avg_shares`): Mean shares accumulated per post.
8. **Average Comments** (`avg_comments`): Mean comments accumulated per post.

The leaderboard is sorted by `follower_count` in descending order, restricted to the top 20 creators.

## 2. SQL Query

The complete, verified SQL query is stored in [`sql/challenge_02_top_creator_audience.sql`](../sql/challenge_02_top_creator_audience.sql):

```sql
SELECT
    u.user_id,
    u.location,
    u.language,
    u.follower_count,
    COUNT(p.post_id) AS post_count,
    ROUND(AVG(p.likes), 2) AS avg_likes,
    ROUND(AVG(p.shares), 2) AS avg_shares,
    ROUND(AVG(p.comments), 2) AS avg_comments
FROM users u
INNER JOIN posts p ON u.user_id = p.user_id
GROUP BY
    u.user_id,
    u.location,
    u.language,
    u.follower_count
ORDER BY u.follower_count DESC
LIMIT 20;
```

## 3. Query Explanation

Below is an explanation of each clause and operational construct used in the query:

1. **`INNER JOIN posts p ON u.user_id = p.user_id`**:
   - Matches rows between the parent `users` table and the child `posts` table based on the relational foreign key `u.user_id = p.user_id`.
   - By using an `INNER JOIN`, users who have zero posts would be naturally excluded (though Phase 1 verified that all 1,500 users have authored posts).
   - Enables simultaneous retrieval of user-level demographics (`follower_count`, `location`, `language`) alongside post-level engagement metrics.

2. **`GROUP BY u.user_id, u.location, u.language, u.follower_count`**:
   - Collapses the multiple individual post records authored by each user into a single summary record per creator.
   - Including all selected non-aggregated columns in the `GROUP BY` clause adheres strictly to ANSI SQL standard grouping rules.

3. **`COUNT(p.post_id) AS post_count`**:
   - Counts the primary keys of the posts table associated with each user.
   - Accurately reports total authored post volume regardless of whether optional fields (like `likes` or `platform`) contain `NULL`s.

4. **`ROUND(AVG(p.likes), 2) AS avg_likes`**:
   - Computes the arithmetic mean of likes for each user's post portfolio.
   - Standard SQL `AVG()` ignores `NULL` likes automatically, calculating the average strictly over posts that have recorded like counts.
   - `ROUND(..., 2)` rounds the average to two decimal places.

5. **`ROUND(AVG(p.shares), 2)` & `ROUND(AVG(p.comments), 2)`**:
   - Calculate the mean shares and comments per post for each user. Because shares and comments contain zero missing values, the average covers all authored posts.

6. **`ORDER BY u.follower_count DESC`**:
   - Sorts the aggregated creator records from the largest audience size to the smallest.

7. **`LIMIT 20`**:
   - Truncates the output to the top 20 creators with the highest follower counts.

## 4. Results

Executing the query against [`data/data_vortex.db`](../data/data_vortex.db) generates 1,500 total creator rows before the `LIMIT` clause. The top 20 rows are presented in Table 4.1.

## 5. Key Findings

### 5.1 Identified Extreme Entities
1. **Highest Follower Count User:**
   - **`user_3o7w66o2`** ranks #1 overall with **49,944 followers** (Location: Berlin, Germany; Language: `ja`). Authored 8 posts averaging 3,394.00 likes, 724.50 shares, and 683.38 comments.
2. **Highest Number of Posts User:**
   - **Within Top 20:** **`user_ujllj1n7`** (Rank #6) with **16 posts** (49,855 followers; Location: Chicago, USA).
   - **Across Overall Database:** **`user_zqv2vrf5`** with **22 posts** (Location: San Jose, USA; Language: `ja`; follower count: 13,531; avg likes: 2,533.79).
3. **Highest Average Likes User:**
   - **Within Top 20:** **`user_3o7w66o2`** with **3,394.00 average likes**.
   - **Across Overall Database:** **`user_uw0vd87k`** with **4,821.33 average likes** (Follower count: 11,640; Location: Milan, Italy; Language: `hi`; 6 posts).

### 5.2 Do Highest Followers Correspond to Highest Engagement?
**The data shows that highest follower counts do NOT systematically correspond to highest post engagement.**

#### Concrete Evidence from the Results:
1. **Wide Variance at the Top:** Within the top 20 creators (all possessing between 49,341 and 49,944 followers), average likes per post vary by more than **2.1x**, ranging from **1,600.33** (`user_ixw57ddo`, 49,484 followers) to **3,394.00** (`user_3o7w66o2`, 49,944 followers).
2. **Underperforming Mega-Followers:** Multiple creators in the top 20 average substantially lower engagement than the overall database mean of 2,491.86 likes:
   - `user_ixw57ddo` (49,484 followers) averages only **1,600.33 likes** (-35.8% below database mean).
   - `user_kr0ydzhh` (49,836 followers) averages only **1,677.89 likes** (-32.7% below database mean).
   - `user_b8ysn8r5` (49,699 followers) averages only **1,871.50 likes** (-24.9% below database mean).
3. **Global Engagement Leader Has Low Audience Reach:** Across all 1,500 users, the single highest average likes performance (**4,821.33 likes**) belongs to `user_uw0vd87k`, who possesses only **11,640 followers** (placing them in the lowest follower quartile Q1).
4. **Conclusion:** High audience reach does not translate to higher engagement in this dataset. The empirical observations are consistent with the Phase 1 finding of complete decoupling between follower counts and interaction metrics ($r = +0.0082, p = 0.4063$).

## 6. NULL Handling

1. **Natural Ignorance of NULLs in `AVG()`:**
   - In SQL, `AVG(p.likes)` computes $\frac{\sum \text{non-null likes}}{\text{count of non-null likes}}$.
   - For example, if a user authored 8 posts and 1 post had missing likes, the average is divided by 7.
   - This ensures the reported metric reflects the true observed average likes per populated post without artificial downward deflation.
2. **Accurate Post Volume Counting:**
   - `COUNT(p.post_id)` counts the primary keys of the joined posts table.
   - Because `post_id` is defined as `NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY`, every post authored by the user is counted, regardless of whether `platform`, `text_content`, or `likes` contain `NULL`s.
3. **Zero Value Substitution Avoided:**
   - Missing likes were NOT replaced with zeros for this leaderboard. Replacing missing likes with zero would artificially penalize users who published posts with missing like metadata.

---

## 7. Interpretation & Limitations

1. **Non-Causal Relationship:**
   - The observed data confirms that having high follower numbers does not cause higher post interactions.
2. **Demographic Synthesis:**
   - Top creators exhibit international diversity across 13 distinct metropolitan locations and 8 languages, consistent with synthetic random allocation rather than regional concentration.
3. **Post Volume Uniformity:**
   - Authored post counts for top creators range between 5 and 16 posts, matching the expected Poisson distribution ($\lambda = 8.0$) observed during EDA.
